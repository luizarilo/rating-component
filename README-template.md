### What I learned

In this project I learned how to custom a radio input

```css
.input__radio{
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    -moz-appearance: none;
    appearance: none;
    width: 50px;
    border-radius: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: #262F38;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    float: left;
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.4s;
}

```

And how to make a modal 

```html
div class="modal__box">
        <div id="myModal" class="modal">
          <div class="modal__content">
            <span class="close">&times;</span>
            <img class = "modal__image" src = "images/illustration-thank-you.svg" class = "moda__image">
            <div class = "text__rating">
              <p>You selected <span id = "rating__select"></span> out of 5</p>
            </div>
            <h1 class = "rating__title">Thank you!</h1>
            <h4 class = "rating__subtitle">
              We appreciate you taking the time to give a rating. If you ever need more support, 
              donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!
            </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
```
